Approach to the LinkedIn PDF Resume to HTML Converter Project:

I started by understanding the key requirements: we needed a web application that accepts a LinkedIn PDF, extracts its contents, and converts it into an HTML resume using the OpenAI API. The app should prompt the user for their OpenAI API key at runtime.

Key Steps:
Technology Stack Selection:
I opted to use Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, to build the application. Flask would handle file uploads and form submissions. To extract text from the PDF, I used PyPDF2, and the OpenAI API was leveraged to generate HTML from the extracted text.

Frontend (User Interface):
I created a simple HTML form to allow users to upload their LinkedIn PDF and enter their OpenAI API key. This form sends a POST request to the backend for processing.

Backend Development:
On the backend, Flask manages the uploaded PDF and API key. The PDF is processed using PyPDF2, extracting the text from all its pages. The extracted text is then passed as a prompt to the OpenAI API, which generates a professional HTML version of the resume. The resulting HTML is sent back to the user as a downloadable file.

Error Handling:
I included error handling to manage common issues like missing files or invalid API keys. I also integrated error handling for quota limits on the OpenAI API, prompting the user if they exceed their usage quota.

Addressing Issues Along the Way:
We faced some issues during development, such as missing templates and deprecated models in the OpenAI API. I resolved these by ensuring that our template files were correctly placed and by switching from the deprecated text-davinci-003 model to gpt-3.5-turbo. Additionally, I provided solutions for handling OpenAI quota and access errors.

Deployment:
I deployed it in github
Steps I took to deploy the project folder to GitHub:

Initialized the Git repository: First, I navigated to the project folder on my local machine and initialized a Git repository by running git init. This set up the folder to start tracking changes using Git.

Staged and committed the files: I added all the files in the project folder to the staging area using git add .. After that, I committed the files with a meaningful message using git commit -m "Initial commit for project". This saved the current state of the project in the local repository.

Created a GitHub repository: I logged into GitHub and created a new repository to store the project. I kept it public as per the requirement and left it without any pre-initialized files (no README, .gitignore, etc.).

Linked the local repository to GitHub: I connected my local Git repository to the new GitHub repository using the command git remote add origin <repository-URL>, where the URL points to the GitHub repository.

Pushed the project to GitHub: Finally, I pushed the local changes to GitHub using git push -u origin master. This ensured that the contents of my local project folder were now available in the GitHub repository.

Outcome:
The application successfully converts LinkedIn PDFs into HTML resumes, allowing users to download the HTML file. Weâ€™re using the OpenAI API efficiently, and the app is set up with basic error handling for a smooth user experience.
